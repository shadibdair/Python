# inheritance VS composition

We have the following classes:
* class A
* class B


* If class B *is also* class A - then class B is a sub class of A
* If class B *has an attribute* of class A - then class B contains an instance of class A


***
# Example
* class ExDate
* class Date
* class Food


* Is `ExDate` *also* a `Date` - then class `ExDate` is a sub class of `Date`

* Does class `Food` *have an attribute* of class `ExDate` - then class `Food` contains an instance of class `ExDate`
